# Football PerformanceClustering Project

Perform clustering analysis on the Data.csv dataset, focusing solely on football clubs that have participated for five consecutive years (2016-2020). The analysis will be based on several key performance indicators for football clubs, including Goals, Mins_Per_On_Target_Shot, Mins_Per_Goal, Goals-xG, Shots_Efficiency, and Target_Accuracy.

To obtain some of these metrics, mathematical calculations will be involved. For instance, Mins_Per_On_Target_Shot, Mins_Per_Goal, Shots_Efficiency, Goals-xG, and Target_Accuracy will require specific mathematical formulas. The aim of this clustering effort is to identify clusters and patterns within the dataset and make predictions about the range of values that the aforementioned metrics must achieve to be considered the best football club among others.
